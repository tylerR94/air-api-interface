# air-api-interface
This repository enables you to quickly initiate calls against the Air API, using a CSV file.

To initiate calls, first place all the contacts to dial in a local file named contacts.csv.

Once you have contacts.csv loaded, run "node server.js".

Follow the command line instructions to initiate calls.
